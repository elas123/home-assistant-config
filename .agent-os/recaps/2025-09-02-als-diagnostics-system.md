- **Configuration Helpers**: Input controls for retention periods, intervals, and system toggles
- **Manual Controls**: Error clearing interfaces and system management capabilities
- **Rich Data Sources**: Complete sensor ecosystem for dashboard visualization
- **Learning Status Integration**: ALS learning system status monitoring and reporting

### 6. Automated Maintenance System (COMPLETED)
- **Periodic Health Checks**: 15-minute automated validation and cleanup cycles
- **Configurable Retention**: Error cleanup with user-configurable retention periods (1-90 days)
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time system health scoring and alerting
- **Emergency Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup when error limits are exceeded
- **Manual Override**: Full manual control for maintenance operations
- **Data Protection**: Prevents system slowdown from excessive error data buildup
