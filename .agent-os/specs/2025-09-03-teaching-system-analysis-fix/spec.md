# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Teaching System Analysis and Fix
> Created: 2025-09-03

## Overview

Analyze and fix the broken Adaptive Learning System (ALS) teaching system to restore functionality and complete missing implementation. The current teaching system has multiple critical issues preventing it from learning user lighting preferences and routine patterns as designed.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Automated Learning
As a homeowner, I want the adaptive lighting system to automatically learn from my daily interactions so that it can predict and adjust lighting based on my preferences without manual configuration.

### Story 2: Reliable Data Storage
As a user of the teaching system, I want consistent and reliable storage of learned patterns so that my preferences are preserved and accurately recalled when conditions match.

### Story 3: Dashboard Control
As someone managing the smart home system, I want functional teaching controls and accurate learning statistics displayed on my dashboard so that I can monitor and manually guide the learning process when needed.

## Spec Scope

1. **Storage System Consolidation** - Fix conflicting dual storage systems and establish reliable database connectivity
2. **Template Sensor Resolution** - Resolve sensor conflicts that cause fallback to non-functional test sensors
3. **Automation Implementation** - Create missing automations for continuous learning from natural usage patterns
4. **Data Validation System** - Implement proper error handling and data sanitation for learned patterns
5. **Learning Integration** - Complete the integration between routine detection and main ALS system

## Out of Scope

- Complete redesign of the ALS architecture
- Hardware sensor modifications or replacements
- Integration with external learning systems
- Advanced machine learning algorithms beyond pattern recognition
- Mobile app development for teaching controls

## Expected Deliverable

1. Teaching system consistently learns and applies lighting preferences based on contextual conditions
2. Dashboard displays accurate learning statistics and functional manual teaching controls
3. Automated learning occurs from natural usage without requiring manual intervention
