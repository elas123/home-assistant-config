# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-03-teaching-system-analysis-fix/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Storage System Requirements
- Consolidate dual storage systems (SQLite vs input_text entities) into single reliable solution
- Validate database connectivity and implement proper path resolution for SQLite database
- Ensure data consistency and prevent synchronization conflicts between storage methods
- Implement proper error handling for database connection failures

### Template Sensor Requirements
- Resolve conflicts between complex functional sensors and simple test sensors
- Ensure template sensors load properly and display dynamic learning data
- Fix placeholder functionality showing static values instead of real-time learning metrics
- Validate sensor availability and provide fallback values for unavailable sensors

### Automation System Requirements
- Implement missing automations for continuous learning from natural user interactions
- Create automatic brightness teaching triggers based on manual light adjustments
- Integrate routine timing detection with main ALS learning system
- Ensure proper event handling and state management for learning triggers
