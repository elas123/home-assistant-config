# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: ALS Diagnostics & Alert System
> Created: 2025-09-02
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive monitoring, error tracking, and alert system for the Home Assistant Adaptive Learning System (ALS) that provides real-time diagnostics, room-scoped error classification, visual health indicators, intelligent notifications, and automated maintenance to ensure reliable operation of the entire smart home automation ecosystem.

## User Stories

### Smart Home Owner Seeking System Reliability

As a homeowner with complex Home Assistant automation, I want a comprehensive monitoring system that automatically detects and classifies errors by room and system component, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues without manually checking logs or guessing where problems are occurring.

The system will capture system_log events, automatically classify them by location (bedroom, kitchen, living room, etc.), maintain error feeds for troubleshooting history, and provide visual health indicators (游릴/游릳/游린 health pills) for instant system status assessment. This eliminates the need to manually monitor logs and provides proactive issue detection.

### Automation Enthusiast Wanting Proactive Monitoring

As someone who values reliable smart home automation, I want intelligent notifications that only alert me when system health actually changes, with deep links to diagnostic dashboards, so that I can maintain my system without notification fatigue or missing critical issues.

The notification system will monitor health status changes, send contextual alerts with room-specific error information, and provide direct navigation to diagnostic interfaces. This ensures I'm informed about real issues while avoiding spam from normal operations.

### Technical User Needing Diagnostic Insights

As a technical user managing a complex ALS setup, I want detailed diagnostic reports showing learning system status, room-specific error patterns, and configurable error retention, so that I can troubleshoot issues systematically and maintain optimal system performance over time.

The diagnostic framework will provide comprehensive system reports, track error patterns by room and component, maintain configurable error history (1-30 days), and offer manual override controls for fine-tuning system behavior during maintenance or troubleshooting periods.

## Spec Scope

1. **Error Capture Engine** - Automated system_log event monitoring with intelligent filtering for ALS-related errors and room-based classification
2. **Room-Scoped Diagnostics** - Individual error tracking and health monitoring for each room (bedroom, kitchen, living room, bathroom, hallway, laundry) 
3. **Visual Health System** - Color-coded health pills (游릴/游릳/游린) providing instant visual status for global system and individual rooms
4. **Smart Notification Framework** - Intelligent alerts that trigger only on health status changes with deep links to diagnostic dashboards
5. **Diagnostic Dashboard Integration** - Rich data sources and sensors for comprehensive system status visualization and manual control interfaces
6. **Automated Maintenance System** - Configurable error cleanup, periodic health checks, and retention management to prevent data buildup

## Out of Scope

- Integration with external monitoring services (Grafana, Prometheus)
- Mobile app companion features for diagnostics
- Email or SMS notification methods (focused on Home Assistant notifications)
- Historical trend analysis or machine learning on error patterns
- Integration with external logging systems (rsyslog, ELK stack)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Error Monitoring** - System successfully captures, classifies, and stores ALS-related errors with 100% uptime and room-accurate classification
2. **Reliable Health Indicators** - Visual health pills accurately reflect system status with real-time updates and proper aggregation from room-level to system-level health
3. **Effective Alert System** - Notifications trigger appropriately on status changes with proper deep linking to diagnostic interfaces and zero false positives after configuration
