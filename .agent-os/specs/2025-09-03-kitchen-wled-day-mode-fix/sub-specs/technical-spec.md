# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-03-kitchen-wled-day-mode-fix/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Day Mode Detection Requirements
- Verify input_select.home_state correctly transitions to "Day" mode
- Ensure day mode triggers are not blocked by conflicting conditions
- Validate sun elevation and time-based day mode detection logic
- Check for any overrides or exceptions in the automation

### WLED Integration Requirements
- Test WLED device connectivity and response to Home Assistant commands
- Verify WLED entity states are properly reflected in Home Assistant
- Ensure WLED turn_off service calls are being executed successfully
- Check for any WLED-specific error conditions or communication timeouts

### Kitchen Automation Requirements
- Review kitchen motion light automation logic for day mode conditions
- Verify automation trigger conditions include proper day mode checks
- Ensure kitchen WLED entities are correctly referenced in automations
- Check for conflicting automations that might prevent light shutoff

### Logging and Monitoring Requirements
- Implement detailed logging for kitchen WLED state changes
- Add automation trace logging for day mode transitions
- Create monitoring for failed WLED commands
- Establish alerting for automation execution failures

## Approach

### Root Cause Analysis
1. Examine Home Assistant logs when issue occurred
2. Check automation trace history for kitchen WLED automations
3. Verify WLED device status and communication logs
4. Analyze day mode state transitions and timing

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Log Analysis**: Review existing logs to identify failure point
2. **State Verification**: Check current states of all related entities
3. **Automation Testing**: Test day mode automation manually
4. **WLED Communication**: Verify direct WLED control works properly

### Testing Approach
1. Manual testing of day mode transition with kitchen WLED
2. Automation trace analysis during test runs
3. WLED device communication verification
4. End-to-end testing of complete day mode automation cycle

## Integration Requirements

### Home Assistant Integration
- Maintain compatibility with existing input_select.home_state logic
- Preserve existing kitchen motion automation functionality
- Ensure proper integration with WLED component
- Maintain automation ID and naming conventions

### WLED Device Integration
- Verify WLED device firmware compatibility with HA integration
- Ensure network connectivity between HA and WLED device
- Validate WLED JSON API responses and command execution
- Check WLED device configuration for any scheduling conflicts

## Performance Criteria

### Response Time Criteria
- Day mode detection: ≤ 30 seconds from trigger event
- WLED command execution: ≤ 2 seconds for state changes
- Automation processing: ≤ 5 seconds from trigger to action

### Reliability Criteria
- Day mode automation success rate: ≥ 99% across all days
- WLED command success rate: ≥ 99% for on/off operations
- Automation trigger reliability: ≥ 99% detection of state changes

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies required. The implementation will utilize:
- Existing Home Assistant automation framework
- Current WLED integration and component
- Present input_select and sensor entities for day mode detection
- Established logging and trace capabilities
