> Spec: Kitchen WLED Day Mode Fix
> Created: 2025-09-03

## Overview

Fix the kitchen WLED automation that failed to turn off lights during day mode. The lights remained on when they should have automatically turned off based on the day mode automation logic.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Automatic Day Mode Light Control
As a homeowner, I want the kitchen WLED lights to automatically turn off during day mode, so that unnecessary power consumption is avoided and the lighting follows the expected schedule.

### Story 2: Reliable Day Detection
As someone using the adaptive lighting system, I want the day mode detection to work consistently, so that lights turn off reliably when sufficient daylight is available.

### Story 3: WLED Integration Reliability
As a user of WLED strips in the kitchen, I want the Home Assistant integration to reliably control the WLED device state, so that automation commands are properly executed.

## Spec Scope

1. **Day Mode Detection Analysis** - Investigate why day mode didn't trigger light shutoff
2. **WLED Integration Check** - Verify WLED device communication and command execution
3. **Automation Logic Review** - Examine kitchen motion/day mode automation rules
4. **Condition Logic Fix** - Ensure proper day mode conditions in automation

## Out of Scope

- Complete redesign of kitchen lighting automation
- Hardware troubleshooting of WLED strips
- Integration with other room lighting systems
- Advanced scheduling beyond existing day mode logic

## Expected Deliverable

Kitchen WLED lights reliably turn off during day mode with proper automation logging and error handling to prevent future occurrences of this issue.
