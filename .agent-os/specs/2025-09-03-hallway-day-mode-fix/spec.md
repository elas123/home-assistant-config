# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Hallway Day Mode Fix
> Created: 2025-09-03
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix the hallway lights automation to properly activate during day mode when motion is detected. The current adaptive automation system fails to turn on hallway lights during daytime hours despite motion detection being active.

## User Stories

**Story 1: Daytime Motion Detection**
As a homeowner walking through the hallway during daytime hours, I want the lights to automatically turn on when I enter the hallway so that I have adequate illumination regardless of the time of day.

**Story 2: Consistent Automation Behavior**
As a user of the adaptive automation system, I want the hallway lights to behave consistently across all time periods (day/night modes) so that I don't experience unexpected dark hallways during any part of the day.

**Story 3: Motion-Based Activation**
As someone moving through the hallway, I want the lights to respond to my presence during day mode with appropriate brightness levels so that the automation feels natural and responsive.

## Spec Scope

1. Debug and fix the day mode detection logic in hallway automation
2. Ensure motion sensors properly trigger light activation during daytime hours
3. Implement appropriate brightness levels for day mode hallway lighting
4. Validate that existing night mode functionality remains unaffected
5. Test automation response times and reliability during day mode transitions

## Out of Scope

- Complete redesign of the adaptive automation system
- Changes to other room automations beyond hallway
- Hardware modifications or sensor replacements
- Integration with external lighting systems
- Advanced scheduling or custom time-based rules

## Expected Deliverable

1. Hallway lights consistently activate when motion is detected during day mode hours
2. Automation maintains proper brightness levels appropriate for daytime use
3. All existing night mode and transition functionality continues to work without regression
