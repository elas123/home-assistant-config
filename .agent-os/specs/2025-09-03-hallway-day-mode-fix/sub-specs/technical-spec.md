# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-03-hallway-day-mode-fix/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-03
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Motion Detection Requirements
- Motion sensors must trigger light activation during day mode hours (defined as when `sun.sun` elevation > 0°)
- Motion detection sensitivity and timeout values must remain consistent across day/night modes
- Motion events must properly propagate to the hallway automation logic during daytime hours

### Brightness Calculation Requirements
- Day mode brightness levels must be calculated based on ambient light sensor (ALS) readings
- Minimum day mode brightness: 30% of maximum light output
- Maximum day mode brightness: 70% of maximum light output when insufficient natural light detected
- Brightness calculation must account for current ALS readings to avoid over-illumination

### Day Mode Logic Requirements
- Day mode detection must use consistent sun elevation calculations with existing system
- Automation must differentiate between day mode activation and night mode activation
- Day mode timing logic must not conflict with existing night mode or transition periods
- Light activation delay during day mode: maximum 2 seconds from motion detection

### State Management Requirements
- Hallway light states must be properly tracked during day mode operations
- Automation must handle rapid mode transitions (day to night, night to day) without state conflicts
- Light timeout behavior during day mode: 5 minutes of no motion detection before auto-off

## Approach

### Root Cause Analysis
1. Analyze current hallway automation configuration to identify day mode logic gaps
2. Review motion sensor entity states and their integration with day mode conditions
3. Examine brightness calculation algorithms for day mode scenarios
4. Validate sun elevation calculations and day mode boundary definitions

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Motion Detection Fix**: Ensure motion sensor triggers are not filtered out during day mode hours
2. **Brightness Logic Update**: Implement day-specific brightness calculation using ALS data
3. **Condition Logic Repair**: Fix conditional statements that prevent day mode light activation
4. **State Synchronization**: Ensure proper state management between day/night mode transitions

### Testing Approach
1. Unit testing of day mode detection logic
2. Integration testing with existing ALS and ILS systems
3. End-to-end testing of motion detection → light activation during simulated day conditions
4. Regression testing to ensure night mode functionality remains intact

## Integration Requirements

### ALS System Integration
- Utilize existing ALS sensor data for brightness calculations during day mode
- Maintain compatibility with current ALS diagnostic reporting
- Ensure ALS readings properly influence day mode brightness decisions

### ILS System Integration  
- Coordinate with Indoor Light Sensor (ILS) data for optimal brightness adjustment
- Use ILS readings to prevent over-illumination when natural light is sufficient
- Maintain existing ILS-based automation triggers for other systems

### Diagnostic System Integration
- Extend existing diagnostic logging to capture day mode activation events
- Log motion detection events, brightness calculations, and activation decisions during day mode
- Integrate with current health monitoring system for day mode operation validation
- Ensure diagnostic data includes day mode specific metrics and performance indicators

### Home Assistant Core Integration
- Maintain compatibility with existing Home Assistant automation framework
- Use standard Home Assistant time and sun position services
- Ensure proper integration with existing motion sensor entities
- Maintain compatibility with current light entity control methods

## Performance Criteria

### Response Time Criteria
- Motion detection to light activation: ≤ 2 seconds during day mode
- Brightness calculation completion: ≤ 500ms from trigger event
- Mode transition handling: ≤ 3 seconds for day/night boundary changes

### Reliability Criteria
- Day mode activation success rate: ≥ 99% for valid motion events
- False positive rate: ≤ 1% for day mode light activations
- System availability during day mode hours: ≥ 99.5%

### Resource Usage Criteria
- CPU impact: No more than 2% increase in automation processing overhead
- Memory usage: Maintain existing memory footprint for automation system
- Log file growth: Day mode logging should not exceed 10% increase in daily log volume

### Integration Stability Criteria
- ALS/ILS integration reliability: ≥ 99% successful sensor data retrieval
- Diagnostic system logging: 100% event capture for day mode operations
- Home Assistant automation stability: Zero automation crashes related to day mode fixes
