this is how I want early morning mode to work. I want the kitchen motion sensors regardless of the day if they trigger between 4:50 AM and 5 AM any day of the week this is considered a workday. End of story no deviating from that logic. If motion from the kitchen triggers is detected after 5 AM. That means it's a day off. End of story them are too logic that are set in stone they never change ever from this. I want you to remember this always. The second part of this is if it's a workday so you know the logic for a workday when that is triggered for the workday. I want you to start early morning mode. If it's after 5 AM, that's when you start early morning mode so basically it boils down to early morning mode only starts when the trigger starts the motion from the kitchen starts that is what turns on early morning mode but it's the time that it triggers if it's a workday or not a workday do you understand that?
